AI Module 2 Challenge

This progam is a design of an interactive ordering system from a food truck menu.

The program consists of a single Python file called menu.py.

The program displays various menu options and prices. The user will select the items they wish to purchase. The receipt is printed displaying all the items they ordered along with the total bill amount. There is error checking throughout the program to ensure proper inputs are made.

Note: No outside code or AI was used in writing this code. The assignment contained a starter code that we used to build on to complete this project.
